    "This notebook focuses on analyzing Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 4.4.1, which measures the proportion of youth and adults with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills, categorized by specific types of skills. The goal of this analysis is to provide insights into the current status and progress of ICT skill development across different populations, supporting efforts to increase digital literacy globally. By understanding these trends, policymakers can identify areas for improvement and implement targeted initiatives to ensure inclusive and equitable access to digital technologies by 2030.\n",
